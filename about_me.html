          <strong>Full Stack Java Development with React</strong>, aspiring to
          build scalable, user-friendly applications that solve real-world
          problems. My educational background and hands-on projects have given
          me a solid grasp of programming fundamentals, problem-solving skills,
          and a hunger to continuously learn and adapt. In my journey so far:
          <strong>Key Skills:</strong> Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Java, React, and
          software development best practices. <strong>Key Projects:</strong> A
          Drug Traceability System leveraging <strong>MySQL</strong> and

        <h1>My Hobbies and Interest</h1>
        <p>
          Outside of coding and technology, I have a deep interest in exploring
          creative and engaging activities. I enjoy problem-solving through
          puzzles and logic games, which sharpen my analytical skills. Reading
          books and articles about technology trends and personal development
          keeps me informed and motivated. Additionally, I like spending time
          outdoors, whether it’s through sports, trekking, or simply exploring
          nature, as it helps me stay refreshed and energized. My hobbies also
          include experimenting with DIY projects and trying my hand at cooking,
          both of which allow me to think outside the box and learn new skills.
          These interests not only bring balance to my life but also inspire my
          work as a developer.
